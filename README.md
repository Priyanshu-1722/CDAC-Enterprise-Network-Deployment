# CDAC Enterprise Network Deployment

This project showcases a complete enterprise-level network deployment using **VirtualBox** with a focus on **Windows Server 2022**, **Active Directory**, **DHCP**, **WDS**, **FSRM**, **IIS**, **FTP**, **WSB**, **Data Deduplication**, **Exchange Server**, **VPN**, **NLB**, and **Virtual Hosting**.

All virtual machines are configured within an **Internal Network (192.168.100.0/25)**. This environment simulates a real-world corporate IT infrastructure and serves as a hands-on learning lab for Windows Server administration, Active Directory, domain configuration, and enterprise services management.

## 🖥️ Virtual Machines Configuration

### 1. PARAM - Main Server (Windows Server 2022)
- **Hostname**: `PARAM`
- **IP**: `192.168.100.100`
- **Domain Controller**: `cdac.local`
- **RAM**: 6 GB
- **Disks**:
  - Disk 1: 50 GB (Partitions: `C:` System, `D:` Data)
  - Disk 2: 50 GB (Backups)
- **Features Installed**:
  - Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
    - Users: `u1`, `u2`, `u3`
  - DHCP Server
  - WDS (Windows Deployment Services)
  - FSRM (File Server Resource Manager)
    - Quota: 200MB limit for `u1`, `u2`, `u3`
    - Image Copy Restriction for `u1` and `u2`
  - WSB (Windows Server Backup)
    - Scheduled backup at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM daily to Disk 2
  - IIS Web Server
    - Displays: `Welcome to CDAC`
  - FTP Server
    - URL: `ftp.cdac.local`
  - Data Deduplication
    - Enabled on `D:` drive
- **Shared Folder**:
  - `D:\PUB_SERVER` (Accessible as `\\PARAM\PUBLIC`)

---

### 2. SHAVAK - Member Server (Windows Server 2022)
- **Hostname**: `Shavak`
- **IP**: `192.168.100.101`
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Domain Join**: `cdac.local`
- **Additional Domain Controller**: Promoted
- **Shared Folder**:
  - `D:\PUB_MEMBER` (Accessible as `\\PARAM\PUBLIC`)

---

### 3. CLIENT - Windows 10 Machine
- **Hostname**: `Client`
- **IP**: Obtained via DHCP
- **Domain Join**: `cdac.local`
- **User Access**:
  - Only `u1` can log in
  - `u2` and `u3` login restricted
- **Failover Test**:
  - When PARAM is offline, `u2` and `u3` should still be able to log in using SHAVAK (ADC)
- **Website Access**:
  - Access `cdac.local` via browser

---

### 4. MAILSERVER - Exchange Server (Windows Server 2022)
- **Hostname**: `MailServer`
- **IP**: `192.168.100.102`
- **Accessible via**: `mail.cdac.local` from all machines

---

## 🌐 Networking
- **Internal Network**: `192.168.100.0/25`
- **DHCP**: Managed by PARAM
- **DNS**: Managed via AD DS
- **VPN & NLB**: Configured for internal testing
- **Virtual Hosting**: Enabled via IIS

---

### 📂 Shared Folder Mapping
Both PARAM and SHAVAK expose a unified public folder:
-'\\PARAM\PUBLIC'

- **Mapped to:**
  - `D:\PUB_SERVER` on **PARAM**
  - `D:\PUB_MEMBER` on **SHAVAK**

---

### 🛡️ Group Policies

- Login restriction for `u2`, `u3` on **CLIENT**
- FSRM policies for:
  - Image file restrictions (e.g., blocking .jpg, .png, etc.)
  - Quota limits of 200MB for users

---

### 🔒 Security

- Role-based access to shared folders
- Network segmentation for traffic isolation
- Role-specific access permissions
- Backup and data recovery mechanisms in place

---

### 📅 Backup

- **Windows Server Backup** scheduled **twice daily** (7:00 AM and 7:00 PM)
- Backups stored on a **dedicated 50GB disk** (Disk 2 on **PARAM**)

---

### 📢 Notes

This infrastructure was developed as part of **CDAC’s DITISS** curriculum. It is designed to simulate a real-world corporate IT environment and provides hands-on experience in:

- System administration  
- Domain and directory services  
- File server and storage management  
- Backup and disaster recovery planning  
- Enterprise service deployment  

Ideal for building foundational skills required in **IT infrastructure** and **network administration** roles.
